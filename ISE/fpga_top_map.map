Phase 7.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

.........
ERROR:Place:645 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal clock
   IOB site. The clock IOB component <rst_n> is placed at site <IOB_X0Y79>. The
   clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer/GCLK
   if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. If this sub optimal
   condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf file to demote this message to a
   WARNING and allow your design to continue. However, the use of this override
   is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is
   recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design. A list of
   all the COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is listed below. These
   examples can be used directly in the .ucf file to override this clock rule.
   < NET "rst_n" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >
